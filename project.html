          <h1>The Great Squeeze: Britain's Cost of Living Crisis</h1>
          <h2>Did household incomes keep pace with inflation?</h2>
          <p>
            Between 2021 and 2023, the UK experienced its most severe inflation shock in four decades. 
            Energy bills doubled. Food prices surged. Transport costs soared. 
            But did wages rise fast enough to protect household living standards?
          </p>
          <p>
            This project examines the empirical reality of Britain's cost of living crisis through eight data-driven visualisations. 
            Using automated data pipelines built from ONS statistics, Ofgem administrative data, and government fuel price monitoring, 
            we trace the widening gap between prices and pay and map how this pressure varied across regions and sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story that emerges is one of sustained purchasing power erosion, with the heaviest burden falling on essential household costs: 
            energy, food, transport, and housing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- CHART 1: The Core Story -->
        <section class="chart-section">
          <div class="chart-text">
            <h2>The fundamental question: Did pay keep up with prices?</h2>
            <p>
              The answer is stark. Between January 2019 and October 2022, consumer prices (CPIH) rose 14 percentage points 
              faster than real earnings. This gap represents a direct erosion of purchasing power, British workers could buy less 
              with each pound earned.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chart indexes both series to 100 in January 2019 to make the divergence visible. 
              By the peak of the crisis in late 2022, prices had climbed to 113 while real earnings stagnated at 99, 
              a maximum pressure point where the average household lost over a decade of wage gains.

          <div class="chart-text">
            <h2>But why does food inflation matter so much?</h2>
            <p>
              Food is unavoidable. Unlike holidays or electronics, households cannot defer grocery purchases when prices rise. 
              This makes food inflation particularly painful, and particularly visible.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the energy crisis, food price inflation peaked at nearly 20% annually, far exceeding headline inflation. 
              While overall prices stabilised near the Bank of England's 2% target by mid-2024, food costs remained elevated, 
              sustaining pressure on household budgets long after the initial shock.

              Nothing captured public attention quite like energy bills. The Ofgem price cap, designed to protect consumers, 
              instead became a quarterly reminder of household budget pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              In October 2021, the typical household paid £1,277 annually. By October 2022, eighteen months later, 
              that figure had surged to £2,070, a 118% increase from the pre-crisis baseline. 
              Even with government support schemes, millions of households faced impossible choices between heating and eating.

              Fuel prices don't just affect drivers, they ripple through the entire economy. Delivery costs rise. 
              Bus fares increase. Supply chains tighten. The pandemic crash in fuel demand (March 2020) was followed by 
              a spectacular rebound as the Ukraine invasion disrupted global energy markets.

              Diesel peaked at 199p per litre in July 2022, up 65% from pre-pandemic levels. 
              For households in areas with poor public transport, precisely those most dependent on private vehicles.
              This represented a substantial additional burden on top of energy and food inflation.

            <h2>The rent versus ownership divergence</h2>
            <p>
              While homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages enjoyed temporary protection, renters faced sustained inflation. 
              Private rent inflation accelerated sharply from 2021 onwards, peaking above 9% annually,
              far exceeding the modest house price growth (and eventual contraction) during the same period.
            </p>
            <p>
              This divergence reflects structural housing market dynamics: landlords passed on their rising costs 
              (mortgage rates, maintenance, energy) to tenants, while house prices cooled under higher borrowing costs. 
              The result: renters bore a disproportionate share of housing cost inflation.

        <!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
        <section class="intro-section" style="margin-top: 100px;">
          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            The evidence is clear: British households experienced a sustained erosion of purchasing power between 2021 and 2023. 
            Real wages failed to keep pace with prices, creating a gap that peaked at over 14 percentage points in late 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pressure was not uniform. Essential, non-discretionary spending categories: energy, food, housing, 
            bore the heaviest inflation. Renters, in particular, faced persistent cost increases that outlasted the headline crisis, 
            with private rent inflation remaining elevated even as other prices stabilised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geographically, the crisis extended beyond London to high-demand regions across England, Wales, and Scotland. 
            The consistency of the pattern across regions suggests structural drivers rather than localised shocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a policy perspective, the findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions for essential goods 
            and vulnerable groups, particularly renters and those dependent on private vehicles in areas with weak public transport. 
            They also demonstrate the value of granular, timely data for monitoring distributional impacts during economic shocks.

          <h3 style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">Aims</h3>
          <p>
            This project set out to answer a straightforward empirical question: did household incomes keep up with living costs 
            during the 2021-2023 inflation surge? The goal was to connect this question to transparent, reproducible data workflows, 
            enabling both replication and future updates as new data become available.
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">Data Sources and Automation</h3>
          <p>
            All data were sourced from official UK statistics and administrative releases:
          </p>
          <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 20px 0;">

            <li><strong>Chart 3 (Energy Price Cap):</strong> Scraped from Ofgem public data releases (quarterly typical household bills)</li>
            <li><strong>Chart 4 (Weekly Fuel Prices):</strong> Scraped from Department for Energy Security and Net Zero weekly road fuel price publications</li>

            <li><strong>Chart 8 (UK Countries Map):</strong> ONS API for rent data + ONS Geography GeoJSON for UK nations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Data collection was automated using Python with pandas for processing and requests for API calls and web scraping. 
            Geographic data were handled using geopandas for spatial joins and TopoJSON conversion. 
            The complete pipeline runs in a single Jupyter notebook, generating cleaned JSON files that feed directly into Vega-Lite specifications.
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">Tools and Methods</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Data processing:</strong> Python (pandas, geopandas, requests)<br>
            <strong>Visualisation:</strong> Vega-Lite v5 (embedded via vega-embed)<br>
            <strong>Web presentation:</strong> HTML5 with responsive CSS (mobile-first design)
          </p>
          <p>
            Charts 1-5 and 7 are defined inline in JavaScript for easier version control and modification. 
            Charts 6 and 8 (maps) embed external JSON specification files to keep the main script manageable.
          </p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">Challenges and Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Challenge 1: Synchronising multiple time series</strong><br>
            Different ONS datasets use different frequency conventions (monthly, quarterly, weekly). 
            Solution: Standardised all series to ISO date format and used consistent temporal encodings in Vega-Lite.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Challenge 2: Map rendering and centering</strong><br>
            Initial attempts produced off-center maps with incorrect projections. 
            Solution: Manually calculated centroids, set explicit projection centers, and switched to TopoJSON for smaller file sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Challenge 3: Interactive hover flickering</strong><br>
            Tooltip layers caused charts to "shiver" or disappear on hover. 
            Solution: Replaced interactive rules with transparent point layers and removed opacity from visible mark encodings.
          </p>
